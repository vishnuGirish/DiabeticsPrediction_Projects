### Input Dataset
=================

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

### Dataset details
===================

Description:
============

To predict wheather a patient had diabetics

Introduction
============

Diabetics is a chronic disease or group of metabolic disease where a person suffers from an extented level of blood glucose in the body.
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict wheather or not a patient has diabetics, based on certain diagnostric measurements included in the dataset.
The dataset consists of several independent variable and one dependent variable ie Outcome. Independent variables includes, the number of pregnancies the patient has had,their BMI,insulin level,Blood pressure, Glucose, Skin thickness, age.It is a classification type dataset


Attributes Information
======================

1: Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

2: Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

3: BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

4: SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

5: Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

6: BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)Â²)

7: DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

8: Age: Age (years)

9: Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0

Steps
=====

1. Importing the required libraries

2. Load the Dataset

3. EDA
   * Analysing size, shape, nullvalues, unique values, value counts in the dataset
   * checking correlation of output variable with input variable and also plot the heatmap

4. Feature engineering
   * Missing value treatment
   * Outlier treatment 

5. Train Test split

6. scale down
   * It is done using standardScalar
   * x_train scaled using fit-transform
   * x_test scaled using transform
   * Create pickle file of scale down using joblib

7. Apply all classification algorithms such as LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBooostingClassifier 

8. check train and test accuracy of each algorithms

9. Hyper Parameter Tuning
   * Hyperparameter tuning done in all algorithms to find the best model
   * And print train accuracy,test accuracy and best parameter
   * I choose RandomForestClassifier as best model in the basis of accuracy
   * Create pickle file of model using joblib

10. Flask
   * set the backend api using flask
   * The user interface is set using html code

11. Model deployment
   * Github files connect with heroku (https://diabeticspredict.herokuapp.com)
